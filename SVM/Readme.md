# SVM Classifier - Implementing ML Algorithm from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier from scratch using NumPy. The model is built using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and supports binary classification.

### 📌 Features

- Implements Hard Margin & Soft Margin SVM

- Uses Hinge Loss as the loss function

- Optimized with Gradient Descent

- No external ML libraries like Scikit-Learn(except for dataset)


### 📊 Visualization

A helper function visualize_svm() is included to plot the decision boundary:

``` visualize_svm() ```

### 🛠️ Improvements & Next Steps

- Implement Kernels (RBF, Polynomial) for non-linear classification

- Extend to multi-class classification (One-vs-One / One-vs-All)

- Optimize with Vectorized Gradient Updates
