# ðŸŒ³ Implementing Decision Tree from Scratch

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using NumPy and Pandas for data handling. Scikit-learn is used for dataset splitting and accuracy evaluation. The model is trained on the Iris dataset.

## Features

- Custom-built Decision Tree Classifier

- Supports Gini Index and Entropy for impurity calculation

- Handles categorical and numerical data

- Recursive tree-building with stopping criteria

- Prediction function for test samples

- Performance evaluation using accuracy score

## Technologies Used

- Python

- NumPy (for numerical operations)

- Pandas (for data manipulation)

- Scikit-learn (for train_test_split and accuracy_score)
